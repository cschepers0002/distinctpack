  		<h1>History</h1>
  		<p class="white-text">Distinct Packabilities is a family-owned flexographic printing company with a history in printing that spans 150 years and five generations of the Simon family.
      
      Opened in Louisville, Kentucky in 1866 the first print shop was known as “The Printing Rooms of Nicholas Simon.” Nicholas was a man of vision who emphasized quality in the printing of business and dance cards.

      For over 90 years the company remained in Louisville with the second and third generations of Simon’s focusing on newspaper and then trade magazine printing.

      Frank E. Simon, the fourth generation, became president in 1954. Frank set his sights on the small farming town of Shepherdsville because he envisioned that the fine people of this community could help bring success to the business.

      In 2010 and in keeping with the same visionary spirit the fifth generation of the Simon family opened a flexographic division, Distinct Packabilities, in Shepherdsville.

      Distinct Packabilities focuses on quality printing and continues the long and proud tradition of the Simon family in the printing industry.
